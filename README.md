ARCHIVED.

This was an attempt at making a easier method to get data from my school's blackboard.as well as an excuse to toy around with python and see some cool things i could try. 

As i've graduated and don't have access to blackboard anymore this project will remain unfinished for the foreseeable future.
The code is badly done as more experimenting than properly coding. 
there are half baked ideas and improperly designed methods.
It did work around june 2020 when I graduated but I have no idea if it still does. 

I got to pulling announcements and starting to get files from my class blackboards.
